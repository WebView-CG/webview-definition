      <p>This document aims to define what a <a>WebView</a> is.</p>

    <section id="sotd">
      <p>
        This document is a work in progress. It is intended to provide clarity on the definition of a WebView, which has been a topic of discussion within the WebView Community Group.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The WebView Community Group has identified a lack of clarity and consensus around the definition of a <a>WebView</a>. This has
        led to confusion among developers and users alike, as the term is often used inconsistently across different platforms
        and contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-goal:</strong> The purpose of this document is to define what a WebView is and which types of WebViews exist. It is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview of all WebView implementations or their specific features. 
        You can find more information about the implementations in the <a href="https://webview-cg.github.io/usage-and-challenges/#implementations">usage and challenges report</a>.

      <h2>How do WebViews differ from other user agents, such as browsers?</h2>
      <p>
        This was discussed via <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webview/2025May/0000.html">e-mail</a> in the WebView CG. <a>WebViews</a> are usually locked down and configured by apps embedding them to fit their use case. Sometimes they are used to build fully featured browsers or show general web content.

        <h3>WebView User Experience</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Whether the user can enter their own URL to navigate to</li>
          <li>"Embedded" WebViews vs "Delegated" Browser Views, which differ by whether they run in a separate context, or the same context as a web browser on the device</li>
          <li>Whether the user may "freely navigate the web" (i.e. browsing, since they are called "web browsers" after all)</li>
          <li>Whether certain UX features are available (e.g. managing security and privacy, back/forward button, bookmarks...)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Web browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari)</li>
          <li>In-app browsers like Android Custom Tabs, SFSafariViewController</li>
          <li>WebView embedded in app (e.g. Android WebView or Microsoft Edge WebView2 as a view inside an app)</li>
          <li>A web browser built using an embedded WebView (e.g. with a URL bar added above a WebView)</li>
          <li>A web browser in "kiosk" mode (fullscreen, no address bar, restricted navigation)</li>
          <li>An iframe within web content</li>
          <li>A web browser with a browser extension that intercepts network requests</li>
          <li>A web browser in private browsing mode</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section >
        <h3>Additional Points Raised</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In-app browsers like SFSafariViewController are usually virtually identical to a regular web browser, differing only by user interface.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Proposed Definition</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>What is a WebView?</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>WebView</dfn> is defined as a software component that is used to render Web technology-based content outside of a Web browser (Native Apps, MiniApps, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look at how the web content is used—for example, if you can freely navigate the web or certain UX elements exist—you could determine which <a href="#types-of-webviews">type of WebView</a> and whether who the user agent is.
        </p>

        <aside class="warning">
          <p> TODO: Clarify UX based definition vs framework</p>

        <h3>User Agent Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Whether a <a>WebView</a> is a <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/user-agents/">user agent</a> or not is difficult to tell. In cases where a WebView acts as a general-purpose browser, it could be considered a user agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a WebView is used in such a way that it's not transparent to the user that they are interacting with web content or the app embedding the WebView is interacting with the Web content, it's less clear if all duties of a user agent are fulfilled, and the embedding app might become the user agent.

      <h3>Types of WebViews</h3>

      <section class="informative">
        <h4>WebView Properties</h4>
        <p>[=WebViews=] can differ based on the following properties:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li><dfn data-lt="UX flexibility|flexible"><abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> flexibility</dfn>: Whether
            the native application has full control over the UX provided by the WebView or whether the WebView imposes
            the UX with limited customization and control from the native application.</li>
          <li><dfn data-lt="Access to the web content|Access the web content">Access to the web content</dfn>: Whether the
            native application has the ability to read and modify the web content rendered in the WebView. The native
            application can leverage this to establish a communication link between the native code and the Web code, and
            in particular to expose native APIs to the Web content, making it possible for the Web content to make native
            calls.</li>
          <li><dfn data-lt="State sharing|Share state">State sharing</dfn>: Whether the WebView shares state such as
            cookies and cache with the system-wide web browser, or is completely isolated.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="">
        <h4>WebView Categories</h4>
        <p>In practice, [=WebViews=] are classified into one of two categories with fixed properties:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>Browser-like</dfn> WebViews</dt>
          <dd>These WebViews are straightforward to embed with a simpler API surface mostly targeted at loading the web
            page. They are generally not [=flexible=], do not provide [=access to the web content=], but [=share state=]
            with the system-wide web browser.</dd>
          <dt><dfn>Fully-fledged</dfn> WebViews</dt>
          <dd>These WebViews are used for creating richer experiences and feature powerful integration primitives. They
            have full [=UX flexibility=] when integrated within an application, provide the ability to [=access the web
            content=] (native and web parts of the application can communicate), and do not [=share state=] with the
            system-wide web browser.</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

        <p>The <a href="https://webview-cg.github.io/usage-and-challenges/#implementations">"WebView: Usage Scenarios and Challenges" report</a> goes into detail and puts implementations into the [=Browser-like=] and [=Fully-fledged=] categories.</p>
